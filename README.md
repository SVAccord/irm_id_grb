Integrated rating mechanisms (IRMs) can be classified as verbal decision-making 
mechanisms.
The IRM is a binary tree and convolution matrices that allow you to get a 
integrated assessment (IA) based on the values of several parameters.
They are capable of classifying or partially ordering alternatives and can 
be referred to as explainable machine learning methods.
